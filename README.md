# movie_diversity
Started out as a university project to visualise the ethnic representation in movies from different countries.
The initial idea was to take the highest grossing movies of several countries in the world and look at the ethnicities of cast members.
The output should be different visualisations presented on a website, including an interactive map in js.


Given the difficulties I came across when looking for databases of actor ethnicities that required a lot of manual research, I decided to switch th topic and focus on gender and age representation instead.
I will first be looking at age and gender representation separately, comparing the results to official country demographics, and then look into a potential correlation between gender and age in films. 
As the project goes on, I will likely look into adding additional layers of criteria.


The second element of the analysis will be the movie selection and groupement. The first approach I will take will be the select the highest movies per year and per country and get both a geographical approach and a chronological one. However, it would also ideally be possible to select other criterie, such as movie genre or RottenTomato reviews.
